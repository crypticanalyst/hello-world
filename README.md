# hello-world

I haven't studied computer science in college or write code; but I am learning. With this read-me, I am promising myself to become a coder like I always wanted. I will learn how to code on a professional level. I do not care how long it takes and I just turned 25. I think we are witnessing the birth of a new branch of technology which will have deep effects on our daily lives in the future and I really want to be a part of it. So here, in my first github repository, I am going to keep this to remind myself of what I want to do, every single day. I will become a professional coder and develop dapps on Ethereum.

I will find my passion. If I'm successful in the future, I'll turn this into an NFT.

Remember Kaguya, your biggest strengts are discipline and passion. Use them.
